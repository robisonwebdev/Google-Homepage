# Google-Homepage - [Live Preview](https://robisonwebdev.github.io/Google-Homepage/)
## Recap
Deconstruct the Google homepage and rebuilt it. The goal of the project was to start thinking about how elements
are placed on a webpage and how to style and align them.

## Future Plans
- Setup links
- Setup random "I feel lucky quotes to button on hover"
- Create a result page
