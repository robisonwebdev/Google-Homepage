# Google-Homepage - [Live Preview](https://robisonwebdev.github.io/Google-Homepage/)
Deconstruted the Google homepage (Desktop and Mobile) and attempted to rebuild it.
The goal of this project was to start thinking about how to place elements on the page, along with styling them.

I used flexbox to help position the element around on the page.
